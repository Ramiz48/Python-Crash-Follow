print("hello world") 
# Python Basics

**Data variables:** 

Boolean =  True or False

String = “Ramiz” any series of characters

Integers = numbers

Float =  1.2, 3.4, 5.7, Basically numbers in decimals

None = None (you can write None as a None and it gives no error which means its acceptable not like other string where you have to must put double comma’s.)

**Type casting** : is basically converting anything into another one like string into int form.

For Example:

          A = “5”

           print(A + 1) # in that scenario we have to first convert this into int like (int (5) +1)

           B = 5

           print (B +1 )

**Operators:**

**1: Arithmetic Operators:**

num1 = 10

num2 = 2

print(”num1 + num2 is “, num1 + num2) 

print(”num1 - num2 is “, num1 - num2) 

print(”num1 * num2 is “, num1 * num2)

print(”num1 /  num2 is “, num1 / num2)

print(”num1 /  /  num2 is “, num1 /  / num2) # it eliminate numbers after decimal.

print(”num1 ** num2 is “, num1 ** num2) # it gives us power like 10 power 10 it makes 1000

print(”num1 % num2 is “, num1 % num2) # it gives us reminder like 10/1 and reminder will be 1
